    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is concerned with four types of geometric objects: Platonic solids, Archimedean solids, regular tilings, and semiregular tilings.\n",
    "\n",
    "All four classes of objects share a common property: vertex-transitivity. That is, every vertex is identical. What differentiates the four classes is two criteria. First, the solid objects must \"fold up\" and so the sum of the degrees at each vertex is less than 360°. The tilings must lay perfectly flat and thus must have vertex sums of exactly 360°. Second, the \"regular\" objects (Platonic solids and regular tilings) must not only have identical vertices, but must also be made up of only one type of polygon. That is, they must also be face-transitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four classes can be identified in a vacuum by simply looking at their vertices:\n",
    "* Platonic solids\n",
    "  * Vertex sum < 360°\n",
    "  * Only one type of polygon at each vertex\n",
    "* Archimedean solids\n",
    "  * Vertex sum < 360°\n",
    "  * More than one type of polygon at each vertex\n",
    "* Regular tiling of the plane\n",
    "  * Vertex sum == 360°\n",
    "  * Only one type of polygon at each vertex\n",
    "* Semiregular tiling of the plane\n",
    "  * Vertex sum == 360°\n",
    "  * More than one type of polygon at each vertex\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common to hear phrases such as \"the five platonic solids\" or \"the three regular tilings of the plane\" and students of geometry may wonder: **WHY are there only five platonic solids? HOW DO WE KNOW that there are only five?** There have been many explanations (see the README for more details) but I wanted to construct a simple code-based exhaustive search to answer this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can begin looking for them."

    "According to wikipedia:\n",
    " >In geometry, an Archimedean solid is one of 13 convex polyhedra whose faces are regular polygons and whose vertices are all symmetric to each other\n",
    "\n",
    "How could we possibly find all of them? Well, it's actually not so hard! We can do this almost entirely in 2 dimensions. **Since these polyhedra are vertex transitive, we can just construct one vertex and it will define the whole polyhedron.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that \"doing a loop\" is 360°. We also know that traversing the boundary of an n-gon brings us facing back in the same direction we started in. These \"turns\" we make are really just the exterior angles of an n-gon. Therefore, the sum of the exterior angles of a polygon must be 360°.\n",
    "\n",
    "From Google:\n",
    "> An exterior angle is the angle formed outside a polygon when one of its sides is extended. The sum of the exterior angles of any convex polygon is 360°.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then find the measure of any individual exterior angle by `360 / n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "And since we know that for any angle, the sum of the interior and exterior angles is 180° (a straight line), we know that a specific interior angle can be found by `180 - (360 / n)`."

    "1. Every \"corner\" or \"vertex\" must be comprised of at least 3 polygons. This makes intutive sense if you think of corners of real-life polyhedra. The corner of a desk for example is the intersection of 3 planes. You couldn't make a box, or even one corner of a box with only two flat pieces of wood. If only two faces met at a vertex, there would be no \"corner\" or solid angle, causing the polyhedron to collapse and not form a three-dimensional shape. This can also be seen numerically by looking at the vertex sum of an angle. For further evidence, we can look at the output above to see that no polygon has an internal angle greater than or equal to 180°. Therefore, every vertex in a polyhedra must be made up of at least 3 faces.\n",
    "2. Every \"vertex\" must be comprised of at most 6 polygons. This is because this investigation deals only with geometric forms which are composed of regular polygons. Because the smallest regular polygon (the equilateral triangle) has angles of 60°, we can only fit at most 6 of them around a vertex.\n",
    "3. The internal angles of the polygons at a vertex must sum to at most 360° because the sum of the angles around a point is 360°. If the sum of the interior angles were to be greater than 360°, the polygons would overlap.\n",
    "4. Each polygon must have at least 3 sides. This is because you can't construct a polygon with nonzero area with less than 3 sides.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, each vertex of a polyhedra must conform to the following rules:\n",
    "* The vertex must be made up of at least 3 \"faces\" (polygons)\"\n",
    "* The vertex must be made up of at most 6 faces\n",
    "* The vertex sum must be at most 360°\n",
    "* Each polygon must have at least 3 sides\n",

    "This gives us 587 vertex configurations already! But wait... do all of these configurations actually correspond to possible solids/tilings?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is where the first big insight comes in:\n",
    "\n",
    "**For any vertex configuration (a, b, c) if a is odd, then b = c.**\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we know this? A great proof can be found at the following link:\n",
    "https://www.math.harvard.edu/media/AllenLiuTheStarsAboveUsThesis.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "I will explain this reasoning here: \"Lemma: If a uniform polyhedron has an odd-sided face, that face must be surrounded at each vertex by two faces that are identical to each other.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We know this because if a is odd, then one of the shapes (\"A\") that meets at the vertex is an odd-sided polygon. Since all of its vertices have the form (a, b, c), each of its sides must border a polygon with b or c sides. These sides must alternate, such that the polygons bordering A must have a number of sides  bcbcbc...\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since there is an odd number of sides, this means that there will eventually come a vertex that is of form (a, b, b) or (a, b, c). Therefore, this would not be an Archimedian solid, and so: if a is odd, then b = c.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can re-state this by saying that, for each vertex (a, b, c) one of the following statements must be true:\n",
    "a is odd, and b = c\n",
    "b is odd, and a = c\n",
    "c id odd, and a = b\n",
    "or a, b, and c are all even.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we have over-counted. Many of these 587 vertex configurations are not actually possible to construct. Let's try counting again with this constraint in mind."
